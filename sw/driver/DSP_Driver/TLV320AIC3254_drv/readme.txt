The DSP driver will be included.

- "dsp_driver.h"	contains the dsp driver generic API and will be common for all different DSP ic
- "dsp_TLV320AIC3254_driver.c" implements the driver functions independant of the DSP flow design
- "dsp_TLV320AIC3254_driver.h" declares the driver header and macros


Below two files should be 

- "dsp_TLV320AIC3254_customer_coeff.inc" contain the micro code of specific DSP flow design which is generated by TI PurePath Studio GUI and will be load to the DSP IC when initialization. 
This file will be included by "dsp_TLV320AIC3254_driver.c"

- "dsp_TLV320AIC3254_driver_config.inc" contain the initialization and configuration value for specific project.
- "dsp_TLV320AIC3254_driver_config.h" contain the configuration value

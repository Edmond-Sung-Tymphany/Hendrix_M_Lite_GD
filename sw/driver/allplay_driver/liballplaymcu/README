For testing on Windows:
- Clone AllJoyn Thin Client in "../ajtcl"
- Edit "../ajtcl/SConscript" and remove the "[]" around the "Glob(...)" calls
- Run "scons OS=win7 CPU=x86 MSVC_VERSION=9.0 WS=off BD=on TARG=win32" from "liballplaymcu"
- NOTE: when compiling from Cygwin, use Python and scons for Windows, not the ones from
Cygwin (tested using version 2.7.5 and 2.3.4 respectively):
   /cygdrive/c/Python27/Scripts/scons.bat OS=win7 CPU=x86 MSVC_VERSION=9.0 WS=off BD=on TARG=win32

If liballplaymcu_test has problems discovering the SAM from a PC with multiple IPs:
- Apply the patch named "ajtcl.patch" to the ajtcl source code
- Recompile liballplaymcu
- Add ER_DEBUG_MDNS_RECV_ADDR environment variable with IP of the network interface
used to connect to the SAM:
	ER_DEBUG_MDNS_RECV_ADDR=<ip> ./build/debug/liballplaymcu_test

Linux version using the serial port:
- The above patch is not needed (doesn't hurt either)
- To compile
	scons TARG=linux-uart
- To run
	./build/debug/liballplaymcu_test /dev/ttyUSB4 115200 8N1


You can use "VARIANT" to select the debug or release version, however, you can
have only one active at the same time because AllJoyn Thin Client doesn't use
different directories for each variant.

In "build/<variant>", there will be a CLI application named "allplay-cli.exe".
allplay-cli accepts the following commands:

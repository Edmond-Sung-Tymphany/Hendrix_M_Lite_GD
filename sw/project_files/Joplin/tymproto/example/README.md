# Proto files

Proto files - source files used by google protocol buffers compiler

## Compiling .proto files for **nanopb**

[NanoPb documentation](https://koti.kapsi.fi/jpa/nanopb/docs/index.html)  

Binary releases of nanopb are available at this [link](https://jpa.kapsi.fi/nanopb/download/).  
In the official [README.md](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/blob/master/README.md#using-the-protocol-buffers-compiler-protoc),
there are steps on how to compile .proto files for nanopb.

### Example
Lets have all .proto files located in `/tym_proto/` and we want to put
compiled files into directory `/tym_proto_compiled/`.  
Lets say we are using nanopb version 0.3.8 that is downloaded in `/nanopb-0.3.8`.

Integrating Customer Changes into Firmware Build
================================================
- Customer should provide a bundled oem-custom-deploy.tgz to be overlayed
into the build structure.
- If the customer provides new certificates and keys for signing and encryption,
delete the content of qsdk/tools/qcom-gen-firmware/files/certs
- untar the .tgz file at the qsdk level to overlay customer changes

- cd qsdk
- make package/symlinks
- make defconfig
- Modify .config file to enable SAM theme changes
	- Package called luci-theme-sam-custom
	- In .config, disable luci-theme-sam-default package
- make

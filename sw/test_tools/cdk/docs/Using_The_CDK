Using the Customer Development Kit (CDK)
========================================

Modifying the Device-Tree
-------------------------
- Modify cus227.dts file located under files/device-tree
- To generate the corresponding binary file, run sam_cdk_dtc (under tools/bin)
- The outputed file can be found in the bin directory to be used for testing

Creating CA and Signing Certificates
------------------------------------
- Use make_certificates from the certs directory to create certificates.
- Run "./make_certificates -help" for the command line syntax.
- See the "AllPlay Firmware Upgrade" documentation for more details.
- Backup the generated "ca" and "sam" directories. If you lose it, devices with
the old certificates/keys will not accept firmwares signed or encrypted with
the new one.
- The "ca/ca.crt" and "sam/sam.key" files need to be copied in
staging_dir/openwrt/qsdk/tools/qcom-gen-firmware/files/certs for firmware
integration
- If the firmware integrator is responsible for signing the firmware, also
copy "oem/oem.crt" and "oem/oem.key" in
staging_dir/openwrt/qsdk/tools/qcom-gen-firmware/files/certs
- If the firmware integrator does encryption, copy sam/sam.crt in
staging_dir/openwrt/qsdk/tools/qcom-gen-firmware/files/certs

Modifying the SAM Theme
-----------------------
- All files pertaining to the SAM theme are in files/sam-theme-custom
- Modify these files directly, then run sam_cdk_theme to stage files

Testing Changes Directly on the SAM Board
-----------------------------------------
- SAM theme files and certificates can be copied to the board for testing.
- Run sam_cdk_theme to stage the theme.
- Copy the ca/ca.crt and sam/sam.key to staging_dir/sam/etc/ssl/certs_fw
- Bundle up the changes by running sam_cdk_upload. This script will output a
file, oem-custom-upload.tgz, under bin directory.
- Copy this bundle to your TFTP root folder.
- With the board connected, locate and run /sbin/oem-apply on the board to
apply bundle changes on SAM.

Integrating Your Spotify Application Key
----------------------------------------
- This step is only required for firmware with Spotify support enabled.
- Spotify requires every OEM to have their own Spotify application key in the firmware.
- Spotify application keys must be obtained directly from Spotify.
- Run sam_cdk_spotify_key with the path to your key file to stage the key
for inclusion in the firmware build.

Changing the Spotify device type
--------------------------------
- The spotify device type can be modified by editing staging_dir/host/oem.config
- Run sam_cdk_oem_config with the edited file to copy it into the CDK
- Use sam_cdk_upload to bundle up the changes as mentioned above.

Enabling Bluetooth auto-connections
-----------------------------------
- Bluetooth auto-connections can be enabled by editing staging_dir/host/oem.config
- Run sam_cdk_oem_config with the edited file to copy it into the CDK
- Use sam_cdk_upload to bundle up the changes as mentioned above.

Package All Changes for Firmware Integration
--------------------------------------------
- Once all changes have been made, run sam_cdk_deploy to create the bundle
that will be used in integration of the build.
- Output file: bin/oem-custom-deploy.tgz
